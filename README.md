Counter is a *simple* [tally counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android. It
makes counting easier. You can have multiple counters with their own names and values. Values can be
changed using the volume buttons.

**Counter is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter)
and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=me.tsukanov.counter).**

## Google Play Store

Google is introducing [a policy](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html)
that's hostile to indie developers. I'm now required to provide my home address for public display
on the Play Store. That's not something I'm going to do. If you are one of more than 600k users
who downloaded the app via Google Play, I encourage you to switch to the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=me.tsukanov.counter)
distribution. While future updates are unlikely, they are not going to be on Google Play.
