Counter is a *simple* [tally counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_counter) for Android. It
makes counting easier. You can have multiple counters with their own names and values. Values can be
changed using the volume buttons.

**Counter is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tsukanov.counter)
and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=me.tsukanov.counter).**
